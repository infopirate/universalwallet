{% endhint %}

## What is it used for?

The Universal Wallet can be used for a variety of purposes. Some of those could include, modifying it and pairing it with your own Multichain blockchain parameter\(s\) file. Using the  Wallet alongside MultiChain allows for an end-user to create a new multichain blockchain and pair it with a graphical wallet. Until the Universal Wallet came along, this was not possible. As MultiChain was operated only from the CLI.
