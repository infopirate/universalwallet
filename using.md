# Using The Wallet

## Getting Photon

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/unibitlabs/photon.git
$ cd photon
$ npm install && npm start
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
